          Boy, I remember when I was a little girl, when we’d get depressed Grandma could always cheer us up. She’d take out her dentures, and she’d take a healthy swig from the aquarium, and then she’d put a flashlight under a chin, and we could watch the goldfish swim from cheek to cheek. We could have watched it all day… but visiting hours were only from ten to four.
